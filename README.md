# Django Starter

This is a starter template for [test-driven](https://testdriven.io/test-driven-development/), [continuously deployed](https://www.atlassian.com/continuous-delivery/principles/continuous-integration-vs-delivery-vs-deployment), [API-first](https://www.postman.com/api-first/), [progressively enhanced](https://medium.com/bitsrc/a-practical-guide-to-progressive-enhancement-in-2023-52c740c3aff3) [Django](https://www.djangoproject.com/) projects. It assumes you’re using [Digital Ocean](https://www.digitalocean.com/) to host your site in production, [GitHub Actions](https://docs.github.com/en/actions) for your CD workflow, [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) to make sure that your development and production environments stay in sync, and [GitHub Packages](https://github.com/features/packages) to distribute your images. That’s kind of a lot of assumptions, but they’re how _I_ prefer to make websites. If you share my preferences, then this starter template may be of interest to you, too.

**[Starting a New Digital Ocean Droplet](https://github.com/jefgodesky/django-starter/wiki/Starting-a-New-Digital-Ocean-Droplet)**
is something you can do before or after you set up your local development environment, but there’s no reason not to do it first.

**[Local Development Setup](https://github.com/jefgodesky/django-starter/wiki/Local-Development-Setup)**
is all about how you set up your local environment and get started developing your Django project.

**[Deploying to Production](https://github.com/jefgodesky/django-starter/wiki/Deploying-to-Production)**
fills in the steps you should take to make sure that your first push will deploy automatically and smoothly out to your production site.
